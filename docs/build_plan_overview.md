# MacOS AI Chat App: Build Plan Overview

## Introduction
This document provides a high-level overview of the implementation plan for the MacOS AI Chat App. The application will be built iteratively, with each iteration focusing on specific components and functionality. This approach ensures that the application is developed in a structured manner, with each iteration building upon the previous one and delivering a functional component of the overall system.

## Iteration Summary

### [Iteration 1: Project Setup & Dependencies](./iteration1_project_setup.md)
- Initialize the Swift project with SwiftUI
- Configure package dependencies
- Set up the project structure
- Establish the testing framework

### [Iteration 2: Core UI Components](./iteration2_core_ui_components.md)
- Implement the main ChatView with message bubbles and input area
- Create the SettingsView with tabs for different configuration options
- Develop the ProfilesView for managing model profiles
- Implement the MenuBarComponent for system tray integration

### [Iteration 3: API Client & Model Configuration](./iteration3_api_client_model_configuration.md)
- Implement the APIClient for communicating with OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- Create the ModelConfigurationManager for managing model settings
- Implement streaming response handling
- Add support for Ollama integration
- Implement error handling and retry mechanisms

### [Iteration 4: Conversation Management & Storage](./iteration4_conversation_management_storage.md)
- Implement the SQLite database schema for conversations and messages
- Create the DatabaseManager for handling database operations
- Implement conversation management functionality
- Add search capabilities for conversation history
- Implement conversation export functionality

### [Iteration 5: Profile Management](./iteration5_profile_management.md)
- Implement the ProfileManager for handling profile operations
- Create the UI for profile management
- Implement secure API key storage using Keychain
- Add profile switching functionality
- Implement profile import/export

### [Iteration 6: Document Handling](./iteration6_document_handling.md)
- Implement drag and drop functionality for PDF and TXT files
- Create the DocumentHandler for extracting text from files
- Implement text preprocessing and display
- Add user editing capability for extracted text
- Handle large documents with token limit warnings

### [Iteration 7: Final Integration & Testing](./iteration7_final_integration_testing.md)
- Integrate all components of the application
- Implement UI tests to verify end-to-end functionality
- Add accessibility features
- Optimize performance
- Prepare for deployment
- Create documentation

## Development Approach

### Incremental Development
Each iteration builds upon the previous ones, adding new functionality while ensuring that existing features continue to work correctly. This approach allows for regular testing and validation throughout the development process.

### Test-Driven Development
Each iteration includes specific unit tests to verify the functionality being implemented. These tests serve as both documentation of expected behavior and validation that the code works as intended.

### Modular Architecture
The application is designed with a modular architecture, with clear separation of concerns between different components. This makes the codebase easier to maintain and extend in the future.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
Each component will have comprehensive unit tests to verify its functionality in isolation. These tests will be implemented as part of each iteration.

### Integration Testing
As components are integrated, integration tests will be added to verify that they work together correctly.

### UI Testing
The final iteration includes UI tests to verify the end-to-end functionality of the application from a user's perspective.

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- macOS 13.0 or later
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- Swift 5.9 or later
- Swift Package Manager for dependency management

### Distribution
- Code signing with Developer ID
- Notarization through Apple's notary service
- DMG creation for easy installation
- Optional App Store distribution

## Conclusion
This build plan provides a structured approach to developing the MacOS AI Chat App. By following this plan, the development team can ensure that the application is built in a methodical manner, with each iteration delivering a functional component of the overall system. The plan also includes comprehensive testing to ensure that the application meets the requirements specified in the functional and technical specifications.
