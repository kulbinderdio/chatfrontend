# Iteration 6: Document Handling Implementation Summary

## Overview
This iteration focused on implementing the document handling functionality, which allows users to drag and drop PDF and TXT files into the chat interface. The application extracts text from these documents and presents it to the user for editing before sending it as a message.

## Components Implemented

### 1. DocumentHandler
- Created a robust document handler service that can extract text from PDF and TXT files
- Implemented error handling for various scenarios (unsupported file types, empty documents, etc.)
- Added text preprocessing to normalize whitespace and improve readability
- Implemented token estimation to help users manage large documents

### 2. DocumentDropArea
- Created a reusable SwiftUI component that accepts file drops
- Implemented visual feedback when files are dragged over the drop area
- Added file type validation to only accept PDF and TXT files

### 3. DocumentPicker
- Implemented a file picker component using NSOpenPanel
- Configured it to only allow selection of supported file types
- Integrated it with the document handling flow

### 4. ExtractedTextEditorView
- Created a modal view for editing extracted text before sending
- Implemented token count estimation and warnings for large documents
- Added a truncation feature to help users manage documents that exceed token limits
- Provided keyboard shortcuts for common actions (Esc to cancel, Cmd+Return to send)

### 5. ChatViewModel Extensions
- Added properties and methods to handle document extraction and processing
- Implemented error handling for document processing failures
- Added functionality to use or cancel extracted text

### 6. ChatView Integration
- Updated the chat view to include document drop and picker functionality
- Added a sheet presentation for the extracted text editor
- Implemented error alerts for document handling issues

## Unit Tests

### 1. DocumentHandlerTests
- Tested token estimation functionality
- Tested text preprocessing
- Tested error handling for unsupported file types and empty documents

### 2. DocumentDropAreaTests
- Tested the basic functionality of the document drop area component
- Verified that it renders content correctly

### 3. ChatViewModelDocumentTests
- Tested document handling in the view model
- Verified error handling for document processing
- Tested the use and cancel functionality for extracted text

## Key Features

1. **Drag and Drop Support**: Users can drag PDF and TXT files directly into the chat interface.

2. **File Picker**: Users can also select files using a standard file picker dialog.

3. **Text Extraction**: The application extracts text from PDF and TXT files, handling different encodings and formats.

4. **Text Editing**: Users can review and edit the extracted text before sending it as a message.

5. **Token Management**: The application estimates token usage and provides warnings and truncation options for large documents.

6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for various failure scenarios, with user-friendly error messages.

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **PDF Text Extraction**: Extracting text from PDFs can be challenging due to different formats and structures. We used PDFKit to handle this complexity.

2. **Text Encoding Detection**: TXT files can use various encodings. We implemented a fallback mechanism that tries multiple common encodings.

3. **Token Estimation**: Accurately estimating tokens is difficult without access to the model's tokenizer. We used a simple character-based approximation that errs on the side of caution.

4. **Large Document Handling**: Very large documents can exceed model token limits. We added warnings and truncation options to help users manage this.

## Future Improvements

1. **Support for More File Types**: Add support for more document types like DOCX, RTF, and HTML.

2. **Better Token Estimation**: Implement a more accurate token estimation algorithm based on the specific model being used.

3. **Smarter Truncation**: Develop more intelligent truncation strategies that preserve the most important parts of a document.

4. **Document Summarization**: Add an option to automatically summarize large documents before sending.

5. **Document Segmentation**: Implement functionality to split large documents into multiple messages.

## Conclusion

The document handling functionality has been successfully implemented, allowing users to easily incorporate content from external documents into their conversations. The implementation is robust, user-friendly, and includes comprehensive error handling and testing.
