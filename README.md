# MacOS AI Chat App

A native macOS application that serves as a GUI chat frontend for OpenAI-compatible models. The app allows users to interact with AI models, upload PDFs and TXT files to use their text in prompts, and configure model settingsâ€”all without requiring complex server-side deployment.

## Features

- Native macOS UI with a clean, ChatGPT-style interface
- Multi-turn conversation support with persistent context
- Searchable conversation history stored locally
- Support for OpenAI-compatible endpoints, including local models running on Ollama
- Drag-and-drop support for PDFs and TXT files
- Secure storage of API keys in macOS Keychain
- Customizable model parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.)
- Dark mode support
